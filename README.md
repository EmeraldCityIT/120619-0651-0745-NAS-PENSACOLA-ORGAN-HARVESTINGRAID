# 120619-0651-0745-NAS-PENSACOLA-ORGAN-HARVESTINGRAID
The "Mass shooting" at NAS Pensacola was a raid on United States Military Personell by human traffickers. During the hour long raid, organ traffickers abducted soldiers from showers, beds, and throughout camp. Soldiers were knelt over duffel bags matched by blood type to dog tag and cut open. Organs were scooped into duffel bags from multiple soldiers of multiple blood types. Media coverage has ignored coverage of lives lost with underreported numbers. American soldiers have no idea that bases are targets of organ trafficking cartels due to abilities to idientify blood type on the spot.

This organ raid is similar to other raids, where large backpacks are used to steal organs from victims. The boston marathon bombing was also an organ raid.
